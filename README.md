#YouTube JavaScript Events#

In event-driven metric tracking, you often cannot reference the play button on a flash video (youtube, vimeo, vine, etc.) so this script solves the problem. The image is a screen-cap of the video still with the play button, rather than the video itself. The video hides behind this image, and thus the image is clicked to play. This image can be tracked with event-tracking software (e.g. HubSpot enterprise events).

This is a solution for those on restricted CMS platforms or those using videos rendered in flash rather than HTML5.
